What's what
===========

src/        - contains the source code for MOM6 that is always compiled
config_src/ - contains optional source code depending on mode and configuration
              such as dynamic-memory versus static, ocean-only versus coupled.
examples/   - contains parameters, input data, paths to data, and some source
              code for static compiles. examples/ is sub-divided into four
              directories named for the style of compiled executable:
              * examples/solo_ocean - uses just MOM6 code
              * examples/ocean_SIS - uses just MOM6 and SIS code in coupled mode
              * examples/ocean_SIS2 - uses just MOM6 and SIS2 code in coupled mode
              * examples/coupled_AM2_SIS - uses MOM6, SIS, LM3 and AM2 code ie. fully coupled
pkg/        - contains third party (non-MOM6 or FMS) code that can be linked to MOM6
tools/      - tools for working with MOM6 (not source code and not necessarily supported)

More information
================

During development, the MOM6 wiki is the primary place to find more information:
  http://wiki.gfdl.noaa.gov/index.php/MOM6
In particular, to setup your development-mode working directory there are extensive instructions at:
